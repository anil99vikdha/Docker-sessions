Docker
-	Open-source platform that enables developers to build, ship, run and manage applications
-	Docker Container packages all application code, libraries and system tools
-	Containers isolate applications from the underlying system, sharing the host operating system’s kernel but running independently
-	Docker platform features a client-server architecture where the Docker CLI (client) interacts with Docker Engine(daemon) to execute commands like
•	Building images
•	Running containers
•	Managing resources
-	Docker images are read-only templates used to create containers and these images are built from Dockerfile (A set of instructions for assembling an application environment)
-	Containers are the running instance of an image template
Key Features:
-	Lightweight: Containers share the host OS kernel, requiring fewer resources than virtual machines.
-	Portable: Containers run the same regardless of where they are deployed
-	Secure: Isolation of process and filesystem for applications
-	Efficient: Enables faster start-up times and better resource utilization
